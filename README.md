# spider-men
This is a project that contains multi web crawlers and some useful tools such as email. Since my spiders are based on Phthon3, make sure you have installed Python3 in your system before you use these examples. Futhermore, you should installed these third party libraries: [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#), [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), [Phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/), [selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html) and [PyMongo](http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/).
